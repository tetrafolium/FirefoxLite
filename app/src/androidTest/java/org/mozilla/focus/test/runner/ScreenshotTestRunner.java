    // https://gist.github.com/benjamin-cheng/cdc8db18746b613067fd62dfe30644cc

    // It happened after the espresso test was finished and the test runner try
    // to send the tracking data back to its server. However, the network call
    // is not tagged which is required by the strict mode on Android O device.
    // then the exception was thrown. So, the workaround is to disable the
    // analytics in test runner and refer to the following post:
    // http://izmajlowiczl.blogspot.tw/2014/08/espresso-and-hidden-analytics-calls.html
    arguments.putString("disableAnalytics", "true");
    arguments.putString("clearPackageData", "true");

    super.onCreate(arguments);
